# Game is Hard — Levels 1–100 Walkthrough Hub

You’re stuck. The game is smug. Cool. This repo is a clean index of every level page plus the few “paradigm shift” levels that usually brick people.



## How to use this repo
1. Click your level link in **Level Index (1–100)**.
2. If the level feels like it has “no buttons,” jump to **Universal Solving Strategies**.
3. If your level is listed in **Hard Levels (quick walkthroughs)**, do that exact trick first.

---

## Universal Solving Strategies (works on most levels)

### 1) Text & UI Audit (the game lies)
- Tap the **instruction text** itself.
- Drag the **level number**, **menu button**, **hint bulb**, and any “UI” you assume is untouchable.
- Try deleting or moving a single word if the sentence is the puzzle.

### 2) Touch Sweep (fast checks)
1. Tap everything once (including empty space).
2. Long-press suspicious elements.
3. Drag anything that looks “static.”
4. Pinch in / pinch out.
5. Use 2–4 fingers (some levels only respond to multi-touch).

### 3) Sensor Sweep (phone is the controller)
- Tilt left/right/up/down.
- Flip upside down.
- Shake.
- Blow into the mic. Clap. Stay silent.
- Cover the top bezel (light sensor area).
- Put the phone flat on a table and do nothing for a few seconds.

### 4) System Button Sweep (outside-the-app tricks)
- Take a screenshot (common “camera” trick).
- Use volume up/down.
- Toggle airplane mode or connectivity if the level hints at “offline / flight / signal.”
- Plug in a charger if the level screams “power/energy.”

5. Swipe right
6. Flick off-screen (delete)

### Level 78 — “put them in place.”

## Contributing
Got a level solution that’s actually clear?
1. Add it to **Hard Levels** as a short checklist.
2. Keep it tight. One trick per level.
3. If it uses phone hardware, say which input (tilt, screenshot, mic, etc).
